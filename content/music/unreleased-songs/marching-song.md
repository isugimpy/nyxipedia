## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
On we march to the battle drum
Through the dark of night til the morning comes
On we march to the battle drum
Until the war is won

Left, right, left, right
Keep horizon line in sight
Walk until you see the light
Don’t give up the fight

Right left right left
Pay attention to your breath
Don’t get lost in thoughts of death
Don’t give up just yet

On we march to the battle drum
Through the dark of night til the morning comes
On we march to the battle drum
Until the war is won

I know that you are tired
I know your body's sore
I know it doesn’t seem like there’s a reason anymore
The fight is getting harder
There seems to be no end
But as long as we are fighting, it means that we aren’t dead

On we march to the battle drum
Through the dark of night til the morning comes
On we march to the battle drum
Until the war is won
