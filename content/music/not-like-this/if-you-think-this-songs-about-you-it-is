## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
If you think this song's about you, it is
If you think that you betrayed me, you did
Because I've had about enough of your shit
It's all your fault, it's all your fault

If you're looking for somebody to blame
Then you better learn to say your own name
Because I've had about enough of your games
It's all your fault, it's all your fault

No, I don't want you dead and gone
I just wanted to get a move on with moving the fuck on
So that's why I wrote you this song
I wish that I was wrong...

If you're worried that I'm mad, well, I am
'Cause I figured out your sick little plan
And I'm tired of trying to understand
It's all your fault, it's all your fault

If you wanna play the victim, get lost
'Cause I'm not about to be the new boss
You called the shots, now you pay the cost
It's all your fault, it's all your fault

"I'm miserable," you wail into the sky
You ask it why spend your days wishing that you could die
The sabotage is messing with your mind
You need to look inside...

The call is coming from inside the house
You're not getting out, you're getting out
The call is coming from inside the house
There's no one else around
The call is coming from inside the house
You're not getting out, you're getting out
The call is coming from inside the house

If you think this song's about you, it is
If you're worried that I hate you, tough shit
Yeah, you should have thought of that before this
It's all your fault, it's all your fault
It's all your fault, it's all your fault
