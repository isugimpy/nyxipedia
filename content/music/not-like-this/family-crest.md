## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I am never safe
This will never be my home
I may know this place
But I'll always be alone
No ties my blood can bind me
To the ground where I was born
I am destined not to find a place 
Where my heart can be stored, no 
I am only one
Do what I must to survive 
Only come undone 
Away from the naked eye 
The bridges were long burned 
But I did not light the flame 
And from what I learned 
It doesn't matter, I still share a name 
A family crest of pure imagination 
A marriage chest of daydreams and of dust 
My dowry is a sick sad fascination 
With making my life into a nightmare 
Now I'm begging to wake up

You want to protect 
Those who hold your secret shame 
Or maybe you're to test me 
Because I'm stuck here 
Being soft and strange 
I didn't fit the guidelines 
I drew on all the walls 
Now maybe you'll admit that 
Only I was here to catch me when I 
Fall into our family crest of opiate addiction 
Our marriage chest of ignorance and blame
My dowry is more of an affliction 
I'm living in a nightmare and 
The monsters are the men who bear my name

I cannot fault my father
For how he was raised

I cannot fault my mother
For how she spent her darkest days

I cannot fault my brother
For the path he chose to pave

As much as I love them
I must plan my escape
If you want to stay
But I must flee this cage now
I have built a place
The reason this foundation stays
Is because I have faith
Trusted myself, stuck to the plan
And now I'm flying freely
My feathers built the nest
Whether I fail or I succeed
I know that I have done my best
