## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I don't wanna be an artist
I don't think I wanna starve
Sure, I do love to draw and paint 
But someday I'd like to own a car 
I don't wanna make my living 
Doing song and dance
Unfortunately, it's destiny 
And art is who I am 

I don't want to be unique, no 
It'd be nice to just fit in 
To be comfy in my status quo 
What it would be to feel akin 
To the average Joe
Who, don't you know, 
Turns his work in on time 
Unfortunately, it's destiny
So the artiste am I!

I'd love to have a nine to five
I trudge to every day 
Cursing my boss for keeping me 
Criminally underpaid 
Maybe if I was normal 
I would finally be free 
And every year the IRS 
Would send a check to me 
I don't mean to be creative
I don't mean to tell a joke
At some point I had to admit
My plans for life went up in smoke 
I was cursed to make a living 
Selling what I make 
Fortunately, between you and me, 
I think Destiny is fake 

At first I thought that I was gripped
By the siren song of fame
That I just wanted the whole world
To remember my name 
Or is it that I wanna lie
To everyone I meet 
When someone asks what I do 
For a living on the street

I don't wanna be an artist
I don't wanna feel the pain 
Of failing at something you care about 
Publicly admitting shame 
I just wanna make things I like 
And do nothing else at all 
Unfortunately, for you and me 
"Artist" is what that's called 
Unfortunately, for you and me 
"Artist" is what that's called
