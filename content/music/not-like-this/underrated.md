## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I don't want to sound ungrateful
But I need a break...
I don't want to sound hateful
But I'm pouring over each mistake
It's not just ego, it's my life
I'm making it work, one day at a time
I thought I could do more than survive
But turns out the system is working just fine --

The passing time I guess has left me jaded
I'm just underrated
Not really loved or even hated
I'm just underrated
After all I've been through
I'm sorry, I can't can't be your ingenue
But if you want love and growth and truth
Then get in, loser, 'cause I want that, too
Get in loser, we got work to do

I'm too old to be a starlet
Never been on a red carpet
Not afraid to do the hard shit
But I'm crying when I sparkle
I know that you're not listening
When I ramble in my kitchen
But if I am not creating then
I can't feel my existence
And I promised the child inside my heart
That I'd dedicate my life to art
And I promised the teenage girl in me
That I would pursue all her dreams

The passing time I guess has left me jaded
I'm just underrated
Not really loved or even hated
I'm just underrated
After all I've been through
I'm sorry, I can't can't be your ingenue
But if you want love and growth and truth
Then get in, loser, 'cause I want that, too
Get in loser, we got work to do

I don't want to sound selfish
But I need a break...
I don't want to sound helpless
But I can't foresee every mistake
It's not just ego, it's my life
I'm showing my world one song at a time
And if you don't like it, that's just fine
(By which I mean of course I'm lying)

The passing time, the passing time,
The passing time suits me just fine...

The passing time, the passing time,
The passing time suits me just fine...

The passing time, the passing time,
The passing time suits me just fine...
