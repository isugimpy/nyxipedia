I can feel it crawling up my throat
I can feel it begging me to take over
Suddenly it's threatening to choke (green monster)
I sound like I'm sky high when I'm stone-cold sober

And my face is truning red
And there's burning in my head
I've still got some learning left to do

You're so pretty, I could die
So much prettier than I 
Compairson's the death of joy
But you're too good to be true

I STOMP MY HOOVES, HOWL AT THE MOON, IT'S BREAKING THROUGH
(You're too good to be true)
I STOMP MY HOOVES, HOWL AT THE MOON, IT'S BREAKING THROUGH

I see in the comments that you're loved (they love ya)
I see strangers promise that they're your backup
God, your public just can't get enough (can't get enough)
I guess I just happen to be Little Miss Bad Luck

And my eyes are turning green
My psyche is a murder scene
Who do I want to be mean to you?

You're so pretty, I could die
So much prettier than I 
Compairson's the death of joy
But you're too good to be true

I STOMP MY HOOVES, HOWL AT THE MOON, IT'S BREAKING THROUGH
(You're too good to be true)
I STOMP MY HOOVES, HOWL AT THE MOON, IT'S BREAKING THROUGH

This isn't about you
It's about what I think I can't do
What I can't see
What I can't be
The green monster inside of me

I STOMP MY HOOVES, HOWL AT THE MOON, IT'S BREAKING THROUGH

So I blaze a brilliant bath
Tell myself I'm not so bad
Try to find a confidence that's true

I am beauty, I am grace
I'm allowed to take up space
You are perfect in your place
And I am perfect, too

I STOMP MY HOOVES, HOWL AT THE MOON, IT'S BREAKING THROUGH
(And I am perfect, too...)
I STOMP MY HOOVES, HOWL AT THE MOON, IT'S BREAKING THROUGH
(And I am perfect, too...)
I STOMP MY HOOVES, HOWL AT THE MOON, IT'S BREAKING THROUGH
