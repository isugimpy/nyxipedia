I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothin' 'cos I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs and I'm under each snare
Intangible (Ah y'all), bet you didn't think so
I command you to, panoramic view (You)
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kicking tunes
Picture you getting down and I'll picture too
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional, mystical - maybe
Spiritual hero who appears on you to clear your view
When you're too crazy
Lifeless to those a definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put ya on the hype shift
Did ya like it?
Gut smokin' righteous but one talkin' psychic
Among knows possess you with one though
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future (That's right) is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
The essence, the basics without it you make it
Allow me to make this child like in nature
Rhythm you have it or you don't
That's a fallacy, I'm in them
Every spiralling tree, every child of peace
Every cloud I see you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise
Corruption in the skies
From this fucking enterprise that I'm sucked into your lies
The Russell that is muscles
But percussion he provides
For me I say God, y'all can see me now
'Cos you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the end of it
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rounds on motherfuckers
Remember what the thought is
I brought all this so you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Fearless, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future
