[[lyrics need correction]]
Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes these feelings
Can be so misleading
She turns and says "Are you alright?"
I said "I must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating."
Come and kiss me by the riverside,
Bobby says it's fine he don't consider it cheating now

Red hair with a curl
Mellow roll for the flavor
And the eyes were peeping
Can't keep away from the girl
These two sides of my brain
Need to have a meeting
Can't think of anything to do
My left brain knows that
All love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
I said it once before
But it bears repeating now

Can't think of anything to do
My left brain knows that
All love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
And I said it once before
But it bears repeating now

Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes these feelings
Can be so misleading
She turns and says "Are you alright?"
I said "I must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating"
Come and kiss me by the riverside,
Bobby says it's fine he don't consider it cheating now

Can't think of anything to do
My left brain knows that
All love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
And I said it once before
But it bears repeating now
