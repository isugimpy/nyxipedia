# Nyxipedia

{{< columns >}}
Welcome to Nyxipedia!

In theory, someday, this could maybe be a useful and informative site about [Kate Nyx](https://katenyx.com) and her work.  Right now, it's still pretty early on.  We've got pages for (hopefully) all released songs from her [Bandcamp](https://katenyx.bandcamp.com), with lyrics for most!  If you'd like to help fix up the missing ones, or ones marked as needing help, please feel free to open a pull request, or if you're not comfortable with that you can always open an issue on the linked repo and provide your suggestions!

## But where on the internet can I find Kate Nyx and join the Kate-riarchy?

Well, I'm glad you asked, stranger!
