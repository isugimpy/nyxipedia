I think it might be because I went off my Cymbalta; it was supposed to be helping my nerve pain but it just made me suicidal. I’ve rejected my fair share of SSRIs and I don’t know why I thought this would be different. Now, it’s “just” Flexeril, prescription strength aspirin, 2 hour epsom salt baths, crystals, EFT tapping (I’ve gone full hippie), BCAAs, strength training, and my dry herb vape. And Percocet if shit gets out of hand.\nI’ve always gotten poetic when I was sad, but it isn’t until recently that I’ve started to be able to use that part of me to express other emotions. At some point, I started keeping my music at arm’s length. I’ve been through a lot of weird producer/manager/boyfriend/client relationships that promised a lot of things that didn’t happen or asked things of me I wasn’t ready to give. I’ve taken lessons but I didn’t go to school for music. I didn’t even go to college. I’m not related to anyone famous, nor do I come from money. I’ve just stumbled upon crazy opportunity after crazy opportunity and risked life and limb to make my life an adventure. I’m constantly waiting for Them to Figure Out I’m not really a Musician.\nRight now, my equally reckless adventure partner is asleep next to me, having passed out due to my excellent lullaby skills. You can hear me playing for him on this weird Dropbox link, sorry, can’t upload direct to Patreon from my phone.\nThank you for making my life possible.

I\u0026rsquo;ve also learned a lot about producing music over the past few years and am at a point where I think I can make something worthy of releasing on my own.\nI plan to re-record some singles and demos I\u0026rsquo;ve released already, as well as several new songs. My hope is to release it in the spring of 2021; I plan to show the process behind the scenes and share any fruits of my labor on my Patreon at www.katenyx.com/join If you\u0026rsquo;re there already you will most likely recognize many of the songs I plan to record.\nIn the meantime, enjoy this fresh take on my 2018 single, Bet it On The Bootstraps. I hope I can come through for myself, and you.\nLyrics #  welcome to the rat race racetrack honeywhere you gonna put that put that moneyyou look like you could use some helpmaybe you should learn to help yourselfyou can bet it all on duloxetineon yoga, cyclobenzaprinebut i say bet it on the bootstrapsbet it on the bootstrapsyou can bet it all on duloxetineon yoga, cyclobenzaprinebut i say bet in on the bootstrapsbad luck never looked so goodprettiest pauper in the neighborhoodman down, stand down, please, god, take the painturns out god doesn’t take medicaidyou can bet it all on duloxetineon yoga, cyclobenzaprinebut i say bet it on the bootstrapsbet it on the bootstrapsyou can bet it all on DBTon diet, prayer, and therapybut i say bet in on the bootstrapshave faith in yourself[bet it, bet it, bet it on the bootstraps]and trust no one else[bet it, bet it, bet it on the bootstraps]have faith in yourself[bet it, bet it, bet it on the bootstraps]and trust no oneand trust no one elsebet it on the bootstrapsbet it on the bootstrapsyou can bet it all on DBTon diet, prayer, and therapybut i say bet it on the bootstrapsbet it on the bootstrapsbet it on the bootstrapsbet it on the bootstraps "},{"id":47,"href":"/music/sage-and-silver-bullets/calm-down/","title":"Calm Down","section":"Sage and Silver Bullets","content":"Calm Down #  Background #   You know, I think this\u0026ndash; that song\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to be a downer\u0026hellip; I mean, those of you who have been following my work for years know exactly who that song is about. And what it\u0026rsquo;s about. But it\u0026rsquo;s so interesting to me that so many people love that song. And so many people say, \u0026ldquo;Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s helped me get through this,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s helped calm me down,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s helped do this for me.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s helped people. Like, I get messages about that song, for sure. And I even had a conversation on Twitter about it, recently, with someone. About the meaning of it. And what it meant to people. And so\u0026hellip; If you are easily triggered by talk of emotional abuse, feel free to click away. I won\u0026rsquo;t be upset.\n\u0026hellip;\nSo, um, that song was written\u0026hellip; Originally that song was called Katie, Calm Down. And the reason it was called Katie, Calm Down is because the person that I was with, um, at that time refused to call me any pet names, aside from the ones that my family called me, which was a little weird. But he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call me \u0026ldquo;babe\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;baby\u0026rdquo; because that was reserved for an official girlfriend. And we were together for three years, and, um, that song is about how \u0026hellip; So, I was in this relationship with this dude, who like wouldn\u0026rsquo;t admit that we were together because I was ten years younger than him. And we were living together, and basically everyone had figured out we were together, but it was still a secret. \u0026hellip; I wrote that song because of how he would talk to me, and he would say, \u0026ldquo;One day, we\u0026rsquo;ll be together.\u0026rdquo; And he would give me this lofty, \u0026ldquo;one day in the future when I matured enough, when I was truly grown,\u0026rdquo; then he would stop just having sex with me and start being in a real relationship with me. And I wrote that song because I was so\u0026hellip; I mean\u0026hellip; Being hidden, being in a relationship that you can\u0026rsquo;t admit you\u0026rsquo;re in\u0026hellip; Being in a secret relationship with someone who you\u0026rsquo;re living with, who is also your talent manager, who controls a good portion of your life\u0026hellip; Like\u0026hellip; I wrote that song\u0026hellip; Long before I finished it I wrote just the chorus. And then I ended up writing the verses after we had split up. That\u0026rsquo;s why I update the lyrics every year to say how long it\u0026rsquo;s been since we\u0026rsquo;re no longer together, because there are still moments in my head where I hear his opinion of me. And how his opinion of me has formed my life. And that song was written from such a place of, like, true trauma connected to my daddy issues and how he filled that place, and how I was just a fucked up person who needed to heal themselves. And I\u0026rsquo;m definitely working on that, and I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten far enough in my life that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel so close. \u0026hellip; I wrote that song from a place of, like, real pain. And, um, we call him The Spider, or The Eight-Legged Ring Master, here in the Kate-riarchy, because I lived with him at the circus. Not a metaphor. I literally lived with him at the circus. Um, and, the place that it has in people\u0026rsquo;s lives is so different now. Um, the people who say they were calmed by it, I think it\u0026rsquo;s really representative of what I can do with my art, you know? Like, I can take my worst moments, and my darkest points in my life, and I can\u0026hellip; I, um, I eventually got out of the relationship, obviously. Now I\u0026rsquo;m married to my husband, who\u0026rsquo;s good to me, and we have a business together and a life together and things. And I\u0026rsquo;ve built myself up, and I\u0026rsquo;ve built my life up. So I\u0026rsquo;m no longer in that dark place in the same way. But it\u0026rsquo;s hard for me to sing that song because I don\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip; It brings me back to that place. It\u0026rsquo;s hard for me to not sing it and feel those things. And I\u0026rsquo;m trying very hard to see it the way you see it. To see that song through your eyes as the lullaby that it is\u0026hellip; Has become for you. Because that is a much nicer way to think about that song, and I would rather play it and have you enjoy it and feel it that way. But I\u0026rsquo;m still not in a place, necessarily, where I can, um, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I can\u0026rsquo;t detach it yet. It\u0026rsquo;s getting farther away, but I still feel like that nineteen year old girl listening to this dude fuck other women the floor below me in our house that we shared together. I feel like that girl when I sing it. And it\u0026rsquo;s why I don\u0026rsquo;t sing it very often. \u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s a tense song. The song is very much about this idea of a future that will never come. It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;baby calm down, one day you\u0026rsquo;ll be mine, in time,\u0026rdquo; and he was infantilizing me in this like\u0026hellip; And he would never call me \u0026ldquo;baby\u0026rdquo; because \u0026ldquo;baby\u0026rdquo; was reserved for real partners, and I was not a real partner. I was a secret. But that song is so, it\u0026rsquo;s so connected to him. It\u0026rsquo;s not like Spring Cleaning where I can be like, \u0026ldquo;Fuck you, Spider! Go to hell! Go to spider hell!\u0026rdquo; Calm Down is this soft and, like, small experience of me feeling, like, totally alone. And like no one could help me. I mean\u0026hellip; I, I really do, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to heal in relation to that song. It\u0026rsquo;s hard because it\u0026rsquo;s so connected to my past and that time in my life. Um, the Spider is kinda getting squashed, actually. His life is not where I think he wants it to be. When we were together, we would produce shows together, and we had this lively artistic career together. I don\u0026rsquo;t think he produces that much anymore, outside of being a part of Theater Bizarre, which is why I can\u0026rsquo;t really go back there. \u0026hellip; But I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely made strides since we were together. There are definitely parts of my life that I thought I was never going to be able to surpass the work that I made with him. Um, and there are definitely people who still remember me specifically from the work that I did with him. But also, like, I moved to Philadelphia and fucked his favorite wrestler, and now I\u0026rsquo;m married to that wrestler. It started as a relationship out of spite, but it\u0026rsquo;s genuinely, like, one of the\u0026ndash; I mean, I love my husband so much. So, I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely moved past the situation. And now I\u0026rsquo;m in a much healthier marriage, with someone who admit that we are together. Like, that was one of the dealbreakers. I was like, \u0026ldquo;You have to admit that we are together in front of people and on the internet. That is a dealbreaker if you do not talk about me!\u0026rdquo; And I\u0026rsquo;m actually the first, um, partner that my husband ever spoke about online in relation to his career. So, um, yeah. I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s a cosmic, \u0026ldquo;fuck you.\u0026rdquo; I definitely\u0026hellip; I definitely, like, did it originally out of spite, and then, like, I drove to Philadelphia like, (singing) \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m gonna fuck Ophidian the Cobra and send The Spider to hell!\u0026rdquo; And then I showed up in Philadelphia, and Ophidian and I spent an entire week together, and I was like, \u0026ldquo;Whoops! Guess I\u0026rsquo;m in love with the snake man! Guess I\u0026rsquo;m gonna spend the rest of my life with this total insane person who is equally as insane as I am.\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s on my last record Sage and Silver Bullets. I called that record Sage and Silver Bullets because I felt like I was exorcising that relationship from me through the record. A lot of the record is about The Spider.\n Kate Nyx S01E20043   Lyrics #  baby, calm down,baby, calm down,it's gonna be finebaby, calm downbaby, calm down,one day you'll be minei can't wash you off of my skinlook at all the trouble i'm ini can't get you out of my headnever kicked you out of my bedyou saidbaby, calm down,baby, calm down,it's gonna be finebaby, calm downbaby, calm down,one day you'll be minein timeyour disaster burrowed in meand developed into diseasei still see your face in my dreamsthree years passed and i'm still uncleanyou breathedbaby, calm down,baby, calm down,it's gonna be finebaby, calm downbaby, calm down,one day you'll be minein time "},{"id":48,"href":"/music/unreleased-songs/calm-down-we-thrive/","title":"Calm Down (We Thrive)","section":"Unreleased Songs","content":"Calm Down (We Thrive) #  Background #  During S06E06, Kate performed this alternate version of Calm Down.\nLyrics #  Corporate Sponsor knows where you sleepThey monitor all of your dreamsThey know when you cry and you screamTheir observance keeps us all clean, indeedSystems engage, protocol savedThe Network providesUnder control, we are all wholeThank you for our livesWe thriveIt’s impressive all that they knowThey can see you watching the showThey know when you’re sad and aloneTo protect our family and homes, we growSystems engage, protocol savedThe Network providesUnder control, we are all wholeThank you for our livesWe thrive "},{"id":49,"href":"/music/make-an-entrance-ep/canvas/","title":"CANVAS [The Nouveau Aesthetic Theme]","section":"Make an Entrance EP","content":"CANVAS [The Nouveau Aesthetic Theme] #  Background #  Lorem Ipsum\nLyrics #  Canvas, the great equalizerTo be painted, to be tainted, by our painIs a still life a full life?It holds no motionNo emotionCanvas [[unintelligible]]Canvas(x4) "},{"id":50,"href":"/music/demolition/card-subject-to-change/","title":"Card Subject to Change [DEMO]","section":"DEMOlition: An Audio Sketchbook","content":"Card Subject to Change [DEMO] #  Background #  Lorem Ipsum\nLyrics #  you said that blonde heels have more funwell, you're living proofi thought that you were the oneso foolish in my youthand the victor for the matchwell, it's pretty cleardarling, you were such a catchuntil you dissappearedbaby i'm a luchador and i learned it from youi fight for freedom and i fight for the truthbaby i'm a luchador and all because of youyou foolyou said you did your bestwell it wasn't good enoughyou put me to the testbut you play a little roughyou say i'm green as earthand fickle as the airbut for what it's worthi finally don't careCHORUSi hate hateto break kay fabebut i got to got to got to sayyou got me pretty good, babyi hate hate HATEto break break breakkay fabebut the gimmick didn't workturns out you're just a jerkCHORUS "},{"id":51,"href":"/lullaby-lounge/cast-and-crew/","title":"Cast and Crew","section":"The Lullaby Lounge","content":"Cast and Crew #     Kate Nyx\nThe host of the Lullaby Lounge!

I\u0026rsquo;ve kind of gotten over the imagery as I got older; partially, I think, because I\u0026rsquo;m learning about what those metaphors meant to me as a writer. We talk a lot about my music in therapy; I go weekly or bi-weekly, depending on how I\u0026rsquo;m doing. My music is sometimes extremely forward and sometimes draped with metaphor and sometimes even I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what the fuck I\u0026rsquo;m talking about until later in my life. I have a lot of secrets, even from myself, that effect my day to day life and how I interact with the world to an unbelievable degree.

Not for a lost love, or a woman I was in love with, but for another queer woman who I am friends with\u0026hellip; Trying to be friends with again. And I wrote this song for her daughter. And I wrote it, I think around her daughter\u0026rsquo;s first birthday. And, um, we fell out of contact due to some actions on her part. But she recently reached out to me again. So, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that the good energy that this song puts into the world will help heal our friendship, because I really miss her, and I really miss being a part of her daughter\u0026rsquo;s life. Um, I\u0026rsquo;m fairy goddaughter to many chil\u0026ndash; fairy godMOTHER to many children all around the world, but it\u0026rsquo;s different to be a fairy godmother to a child in person. And that\u0026rsquo;s something I really miss being a part of my life.\nSo, this song goes out to all the queer moms, um, or moms of queer kids, um, who don\u0026rsquo;t understand that they\u0026rsquo;re in control. And don\u0026rsquo;t hear enough that they\u0026rsquo;re strong in ways that isn\u0026rsquo;t just through survival. Because there\u0026rsquo;s, like, the strength of women, like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, women are so strong, they can endure.\u0026rdquo; But I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about endurance. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, like, power. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about feeling like you have actionable paths in front of you and that you\u0026rsquo;re in control of how you navigate those actions. Um, that\u0026rsquo;s different than being able to endure, which I think the strength of women is often implied to be. Um, and this song isn\u0026rsquo;t just for women, it can be for anyone who needs a lullaby, who needs to hear that they\u0026rsquo;re more than what they look like, or more than the thing they\u0026rsquo;re known best for.

The title is not necessarily final.  I am not a prayer person. I don\u0026rsquo;t, like, talk out loud to a deity very often. I have maybe a few times. I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know that I believe in a deity. I believe that witchcraft has power over us because we believe in it, which I think is true of basically anything. And if we want to believe in witchcraft, then that\u0026rsquo;s the thing that can have power over us. But, um, there\u0026rsquo;s a spell in it that\u0026rsquo;s for self power, and the words of the spell were, \u0026ldquo;I am the magic, I am the guide, the magic is power, the magic is inside.\u0026rdquo; And I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to just say it out loud, because I felt goofy, so I sang it. And as I started repeating it, I was like, \u0026ldquo;You know what? I think I could actually write a whole song, like based off of this.\u0026rdquo; And the woman who wrote Coloring Book of Shadows actually has\u0026ndash; I posted a video of it on Instagram at one point, and she has responded and said that she enjoys it. So that\u0026rsquo;s nice!

I was a natural antagonist, so it was really just fuel for the fire.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if I decided being weird was cool and acted weird, or if I was realizing I was weird and decided that I liked it that way. Either way, originality has always been a theme in my life. Sometimes, I worry my quest for \u0026ldquo;originality\u0026rdquo; in my youth has made me innately Too Weird to be understood be other people.

Driving me crazy.Bell finally rings,Free of all teachers,For only about three minutes,People everywhere,Screaming in the halls,Only 6 more classes to go.ChorusI can't believe it's finally summer now,And how much I wanted to get out,All I really had to do was wait,But what I said back then was very true.Chorus (x2)Drivin' me crazy(goes on forever well actually only five times) "},{"id":185,"href":"/music/unreleased-songs/worst-nightmare/","title":"Worst Nightmare","section":"Unreleased Songs","content":"Worst Nightmare #  Background #  Lyrics #  I'm the kind of girl who makes fun of your friends,The girl who doesn't think of being sweet or even kind,The girl who doesn't ever look before she starts to laugh,The girl who'd rather run and wave and scream a nonsense rhyme.Your worst nightmare!Coming to your school.Your worst nightmare!The anti-cool.Your worst nightmare!Who cares about rules.Your worst nightmare!I'm the strange Miss Universe candidate.The one with weird hair who's hobby's kind of whack.The girl who doesn't baton twirl and never would cheerlead.The girl who hates pink and would rather wear all black!ChorusLeadChorus (x2) "},{"id":186,"href":"/music/the-dollhouse-collection/wretched-hope/","title":"Wretched Hope","section":"The Dollhouse Collection","content":"Wretched Hope #  Background #  Lorem Ipsum\nLyrics #  Don't give up, Hayley Jane, he'll fall in love yetYou need longer hair, but smoke less cigarettesMaybe if you try hard enoughMaybe if you act smart enoughSo, put on your make-up, an impressive disguiseYou'll not need much more than your packet of liesPropaganda for the massesWatching as the short time passesMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're realMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're hereDon't give up little girl, there's still a small hopeAmongst the old shackles, the stone, and the ropeJust another crucifixionIt's not salvation, it's just addictionYou'll need some more paper, you'll need a new penBecause when you're down there, there's no coming backKiss him once before he goesYou pretend that he could knowMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're realMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're hereYou're herePaint the roses redWith a lover's bloodLet's hope she isn't deadOr she cannot loveCut the cord and runLet's hope she stays aliveLiving is twice the funWhen you know you're gonna dieYou're gonna die.Maybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're realMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're hereYou're hereI'm here "},{"id":187,"href":"/music/unreleased-songs/you-called-me/","title":"You Called Me","section":"Unreleased Songs","content":"You Called Me #  Background #   I started writing this as a rap, but decided on this kind of Alanis Morisette trip hop vibe instead. I\u0026rsquo;ve recently gotten into using my full vocal range more often, and doing more dense harmonies.
